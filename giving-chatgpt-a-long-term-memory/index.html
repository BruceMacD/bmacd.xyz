                <p>Like everyone else I've been leveraging ChatGPT to complete basic coding tasks. One annoyance I've been running into is gathering all the relevant information I have sent to ChatGPT in the past to give it the proper context when asking a new question.</p>

                <p>After seeing <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/chatgpt-supabase-docs">Supabase's ChatGPT documentation interface</a>, I was inspired to leverage a similar combination of tools to store the context of my previous conversations. Whereas Supabase's documentation was stored in a vector database, I could instead store information from conversations with ChatGPT for future reference.</p>

                <p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/bmacd-1683785035-0.png" alt="bmacd.xyz"></p>

                <p>I use a Mac, so I created a simple desktop interface to interact with ChatGPT. Before the prompt is sent to ChatGPT, I wrap the new query with some additional context that is retrieved from a vector database (Milvus) that I'm running locally in a container. The prompt that actually gets sent to ChatGPT looks like this:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Given the queries I have asked previously (in the previous section), and your replies (in the replied section), answer my new query.</p>
                    <p>Previous section:</p>
                    <p>(... previous queries I have sent to ChatGPT go here)</p>
                    <p>Replied section:</p>
                    <p>(... previous responses from ChatGPT go here)</p>
                    <p>New query:</p>
                    <p>(... the actual query)</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Overall I've found this to work quite well. ChatGPT understands the format of the prompt and doesn't reference the previous details out of context. I could see OpenAI implementing something like this in the near future, but this is a nice interface for the time being which is pretty economical since Milvus can be run locally.</p>
